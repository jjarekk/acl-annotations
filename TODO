What I want to accomplish first is to move Zend ACL configuration from zend plugin
direct to controllers. Now if we want to deny access for some controllers to the 
user we must add proper entry using Zend ACL API (or other centralized place like config 
file), like that:

<code>
$acl = new Acl();

$roleGuest = new Role('guest');
$acl->addRole($roleGuest);
$acl->addRole(new Role('staff'), $roleGuest);
$acl->addRole(new Role('editor'), 'staff');
$acl->addRole(new Role('administrator'));

// Guest may only view content
$acl->allow($roleGuest, new Resource('news'), 'view');
</code>

I want to have resources with ACL configuration placed in resources class and
I want to use annotations to do that. Resource class would look like this:

<code>

class MyResource{

    /** @acl("Allow", roles="RoleName") */
    public function doSomethig(){
        $acl = $this->get('acl');
        $currentUser = $this->get('user'); // user with specified roles

        if(true === $acl->isAllowed($currentUser)){
            // some stuff
        }else{
            throw new PermisionDeniedException();
        }
    }
}

</code>
