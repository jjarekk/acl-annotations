acl-annotations
===============
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jjarekk/acl-annotations.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jjarekk/acl-annotations)

(If code coverage is under 75% build is failing).

Annotations for ACL with Zend Framework2.
I'm going to use zend-permissions-acl package as ACL library and Doctrine Annotations
for parsing annotations.
For test I'm using PHPUnit 3.7.
